Hi {receiver_name},

We received a request to reset your password for your E-commerce account.

Your password reset token is:

    {reset_token}

This token is valid for 5 minutes. Please use it to reset your password as soon as possible.

If you did not request a password reset, you can safely ignore this email.

Thank you,
